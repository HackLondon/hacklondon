									<h3>Wait, what's a hackathon?</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Hackathons are events where people compete to build interesting
								technical projects in under 24 hours. Students come together, form
								teams, share ideas, and help each other build awesome things. All skill
								levels are highly welcome, so don't be intimidated if you don't feel
								your coding is up to scratch.</p>

									<h3>Can I attend HackLondon?</h3>
								</header>
								<p>This event is strictly 18+. Any enrolled undergraduate or
								postgraduate student, or graduates who are less than a year out of
								university can attend HackLondon. Students will be required to show
								their student ID in order to enter the hackathon.</p>

									<h3>Do I need to have a team?</h3>
								</header>
								<p>You're welcome to make a team before the event, but loads of people
								come without a team. At the start of the event, we'll help everyone
								find a team. Your team members can be from other universities/schools.
								One of the best things about hackathons is meeting hackers from all
								over the country.</p>

									<h3>Can I build my hack before the event?</h3>
								</header>
								<p>No. It's unfair and immediately disqualifies you from presenting or
								winning any prizes. You can think of ideas, just don't start building
								them. You can of course use libraries, frameworks, and templates.</p>

									<h3>For how long can I hack?</h3>
								</header>
								<p>You'll have a straight 24 hours to hack. 12pm to 12pm. You're
								allowed to sleep (but hardcore hackathon hackers stay up), and we'll
								have some fun activities for everybody so you can catch a break.</p>

									<h3>What do I bring?</h3>
								</header>
								<p>A laptop is pretty much essential. Some adventurous types bring
								desktops. Probably a phone charger, assorted cables and anything else
								for electronics you're bringing Warm and comfortable clothes,
								toiletries and a change of clothes are important too!</p>
